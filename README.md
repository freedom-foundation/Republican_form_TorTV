# Republican_form_TorTV
Live uncensorable public access television for a Republican form of government. The most weighty of which being corporal punishment thus the most important crux of the matter, and of lesser importance public funded things such as CSPAN and NASA TV. Comming soon: Live executions!
 The crux of the matter: Michael Wolff frames the arguments against corpal punishment and even touches upon the Church's stance. Reguardless of any opinions this needs to be public to be lawful and either way hiding it away prevents it from entering the conversation. ( Michael A. Wolff is the dean emeritus of Saint Louis University School of Law and a former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Missouri. )
